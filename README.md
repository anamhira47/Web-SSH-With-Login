#Web SSH with Material Design Login Page

This project is a web-based SSH client written in PHP.
It is simple to configure if you follow the steps below:
- Change the $USER/$USERNAME and the $PASSWORD variables in the terminal 
- Deploy all the files to your web server.
- You can also change the home directory where the terminal executes.

Please Note: Nano and other text editors and programs do not work and I am working on finding a fix for that.

The Web SSH Terminal is based on this one with modifications: https://github.com/nickola/web-console
